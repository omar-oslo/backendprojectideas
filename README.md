## List of Back-End Project Ideas

List of Backend Projects that students who are in 2nd or 3rd year of CS(Computer Science) can try out to improve and get familiar with real world project. My goal is prepare this list and create a starter template for each project.

## 1. Hangman/Guess the Word Game
- Develop a game API to guess the word 
- The Goal: 
    - Despite the name, the actual “hangman” part isn’t necessary. 
    - The user needs to be able to input letter guesses. 
    - A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. 
    - You will also need functions to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter.
- Advanced: 
    - Design a simple webpage to show the game as Hangman/Number of Attempts going down

## 2. Tick-Tac-Toe with Computer
- Write a Tick-Tac-Toe game which can be played with computer 
- Make Sure that computer never defeats :)

## 3. Contact List Application
- Design and think about a contact list API which can be used from Web and/or Mobile
- The API should support following methods/functions
    - Add Contact(s)
    - Edit Contact
    - Remove Contact(s)
    - Search and Filter Contact(s)
- Advanced: 
    - Store/Cache the contacts locally in browser for 10 minutes
    - Host the rest API in Azure/Amazon/Google or private free domain
    - More details on hosting/using Azure Function can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)
- Guide/Notes:
    - You can choose whatever programming language you want, I suggest one of these three languages
        - python
        - javascript with nodejs
        - c# or java
    - Choose and IDE(Development Environment) that you like. I prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) :)
    - First try to design or plan which language and framework you will use before thinking about coding
    - Then write a small document like this one with Markdown and Update as necessary
    - Finally you can host the rest api in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) or elsewhere
    - Concepts that you will learn in this project
        - Planning an API
        - Pre-Thinking Hosting your Backend API 
        - Supporting a Simple API across different platform
        - Search and filtering
